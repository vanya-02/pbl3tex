\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Problem formulation}
\par For our project we decided to tackle the problem of the big quantity of the calendars, reminders, task apps, in day-by-day life. This is a big problem that we encounter and this is what we base on. 

From our experience, we get regularly tasks which contains deadlines. The problem is that we get them on different platforms from different organizations like university, work or other places. We get many daily events which take place on separate platforms. We can take and rewrite and introduce the same information multiple times on different calendars and this will take a lot of time and efforts. And all this can increase the chance of error occurrence, much less people that are working with many clients and customers which can daily organize different events on different platforms. They deal with focus loss and this can influence their and other lives like a forgotten meeting, undone work or missed deadline. 

\subsection{Solution concept}
\par After listed above we thought about creating an online platform / site designed for vast group of users from day-by-day life to more specific work and study schedules. The aim of the site is to have a calendar with a list of tasks and a lot of modules that can be chosen and arranged as desired for everyone. We will try to introduce many helpful modules which are integrated in calendar and for getting a better-quality user experience we will introduce assistant that will help user step-by-step how to use and how to organize in site calendar. By creating a site which will help people to organize time, by combining many platforms in one will improve work speed and also will help with reminders which will make planning more enjoyable and easier than ever.  

\subsection{Motivation}
\par Our second aim of this site is to have all schedules arranged on one screen where users can easily interact with them as well due to the introduced assistant, interaction with the site will be more interactive and intuitive. We want users to manage their time-efficient using our site, due to installed custom modules there are no limits about the site's abilities in terms of interaction with users, it can show incoming tasks, show the traffic situation, shows the bus in the traffic, tell about weather conditions, and recommendation about the weather also it can communicate with other sites via API to increase even more the possibilities of user managing time using our site like booking a place to a caf√©, make invitations for events, booking seats to the movie theatre. 

Furthermore, in order to motivate users to use all possibilities of the site we introduce the challenges/ranking system based on how much they use all feature of the web app. 

Not to get too messy at the start assistant will companion users through all necessary steps to understand how to integrate and use modules, how to integrate and manage new calendars and how to use the all the potential of the site.
