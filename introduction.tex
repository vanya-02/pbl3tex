	\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Problem formulation}
\par For our project we decided to tackle the problem of the big quantity of the calendars, reminders, task apps, in day-by-day life. This is a big problem that we encounter and this is what we base on. 

From our experience, we regularly get tasks which contains deadlines. The problem is that we get them on different platforms from different organizations like university, work or other places. We get many daily events which take place on separate platforms. We can take and rewrite and introduce the same information multiple times on different calendars and this will take a lot of time and efforts. And all this can increase the chance of error occurrence, much less people that are working with many clients and customers which can daily organize different events on different platforms. They deal with focus loss and this can influence their and other lives like a forgotten meeting, undone work or missed deadline.  

\subsection{Solution concept}
\par An online platform designed for vast groups of users for day-by-day life activities to more specific work flows and study schedules. The aim of the platform is to have a calendar with a list of tasks and a lot of modules that can be chosen and integrated by choice as desired by anyone. Users will have the option to connect from a catalogue of helpful modules which will then be integrated in the main calendar app for a better and more personal user experience. Like a FAQ tab or a ‘get-started’ option we will plan to introduce a platform wide smart-assistant that will help the user step-by-step how to utilize the platform. The end goal being a platform which will help people to organize time, as combining many platforms in one will improve work speed and will help with reminders which will make planning effortless and a lot more enjoyable than using the traditional organizational application stacks.  

\subsection{Motivation}
\par Our second aim of this platform is to have all schedules arranged on one screen where users can easily interact with them as well due to the introduced assistant, interaction with the platform will be more interactive and intuitive. We want users to be able to manage their time-efficient using our platform, due to installed custom modules there are no limits on the site's abilities in terms of interaction with users, it can show incoming tasks, show the traffic situation, shows the bus in the traffic, tell about weather conditions and recommendation about the weather. Also, it can communicate with other sites via API (Application Programming Interface) (for syncing purposes) to increase even more the possibilities of user managing time using our platform like booking a place to a café, make invitations for events, booking seats to the movie theatre. 

Furthermore, to motivate users to use all possibilities of the platform as well as experiment with new features we will introduce a challenges/ranking system based on how much they use all feature of the web app. 

Not to get too messy at the start assistant will companion users through all necessary steps to understand how to integrate and use modules as well as how to connect and manage new calendars and how to use the all the potential of the platform.
